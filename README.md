MultichoiceProject A Star Search Algorithm
================== 


The quickest way to run this program is to run the astar.jar. 
You will be prompted to choose a map file.
Once you choose the map file, the search will begin and an output 'TheRoute.txt' file with be generated in the same directory that 
you saved the astar.jar file.
